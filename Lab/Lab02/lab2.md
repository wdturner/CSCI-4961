#### 2. Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?
Because it clearify what can the user do on the software and what can't. It gives user permission to do their operations(or not) on the software. And also, it's a way to protect the right for both the developer and user.

#### 3. Why is it important that you SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license?
This will confuse users, because they will have no idead what should can they do and what can't they do (but actually they can't do anything including copy, download, redistribute your program or sometime even access the source code would lead the violation to the law). Especially for those posts codes on github, this makes the program or software 'access only'.

#### 4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher.

Technical Reasons:
1. Wrong model of hypertext
2. Technical inferiority to Mosaic
3. Web's superior infrastructure
4 Cheaper computing resources
Author doesn't think they are the main reason, but I beleive they are at least part of it.

Mind share reasons:
1. Gopher didn't make new advances to fill new niches that arise without changing so radically that it could no longer take advantage of their successful track record. Web did this right. Also not the main reason as author described.

The three interrelated factors that author think are the most important reasons: influence, publicity and open-systems participation.
1.  influence: Web located at the position to fill the Internet's collaborative and international niche.
2.  publicity: Web had the advantage of being a medium of expression itself and also the choice of name plays an important role.
3.  open systems model: Web enabled community to help enhance the system, but gopher not. Also political element shift developers to Web. And also Gopher team released a Request for Comments but it was informational, not standards-track. And they failed to follow up on this RFC with publications of additional proposed changes to Gopher.


#### 5. Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source. Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).

Linux uses the GPL v2. Because the developer of Linux would like to keep the Linux 'free', and who ever want to modify the Linux into another software or make it to a another generation of Linux are forced to remain it 'free'. And GPL v2 fits the properties. But for MIT licence, it allows the software to use another licence or make the software 

#### 6. Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.
