More suggestions for how to answer Questions in a helpful way:
1.	Show the efforts that I already tried how to solve the problem, like read a lot of material, but still unable to solve the problem
2.	Show why I can’t solve the issue, like why I think this issue hard, and what I’ve already try, and what the next step I plan to do, and especially what made me stuck.
